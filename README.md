# Reinforcement Learning — Object Transportation Problem

The goal of this project is to develop a Python program that solves a **Markov Decision Problem (MDP)**.

## 1) Components

In this project, you'll find the following components — each represented by a file:

- [description-and-requirements.pdf](./description-and-requirements.pdf): a PDF file containing the description of the problem the program aims to solve (in Portuguese, PT-BR);
- [execute.py](./execute.py): the developed program itself, written in Python;
- [scenario.map](./scenario.map): a file containing the layout of the problem's scenario in an ASCII representation. This file is read by the program to load the configuration of the tested scenario;
- [problem-config.csv](./problem-config.csv): a file containing the hyperparameters of the training process for the agent the walks through the scenario. This file is read by the program to load these same hyperparameters.
